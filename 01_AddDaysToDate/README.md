⚠⚠ Note

This program assumes logical inputs (e.g., valid day/month values) and is not error-free. 
Invalid or unrealistic inputs may cause issues.


➡ Program Overview

This program takes a date input (day, month, year) from the user and allows them to add a specific number of days to it. The program then calculates the resulting date, accounting for leap years and month lengths.
Functions Explained

   ◽ short readYear()

    Reads the year input from the user and returns it.

   ◽ short readMounth()

    Reads the month input from the user and returns it.

   ◽ short ReadDay()

    Reads the day input from the user and returns it.

   ◽ stDate readFullDate()

    Reads the full date (day, month, year) by calling the above functions and stores it in a stDate structure.

   ❗ bool isLeapYear(short year)
     The most important fuction 
    Checks if the given year is a leap year.

   ◽ int numberDaysInMounth(short Month, short year)

    Returns the number of days in a given month, accounting for February’s leap year adjustment.

   ◽ short totalDaysFromTheBigrnYear(short Day, short Month, short Year)

    Calculates the total days passed since the start of the year up to the given date.

   ❗ stDate addDayToDate(short totalDays, stDate date)
  
  The most important fuction 
   Adds a specific number of days to a given date. Adjusts the day, month, and year as needed.

How It Works

    The user inputs a date (dd/mm/yyyy).
    The user specifies the number of days to add.
    The program calculates the resulting date by iterating through days and adjusting for month/year transitions.
    It outputs the final date in the format dd/mm/yyyy.
