This repository contains 15 C++ projects focused on foundational programming concepts.
=======
First 15  projects focused on foundational programming concepts.
>>>>>>> d5b1e415911249e49f3a78f2a5a7a0cba967c66b

 These projects were written using functional programming principles,

 meaning no class structures or advanced C++ features were used. Instead,

 the emphasis was placed on basic concepts to help build a strong understanding of programming fundamentals.

Although these projects can be further improved by incorporating classes, 

advanced C++ tools, and techniques, the goal here was to concentrate on simpler approaches.

 Additionally, please note that these projects may contain bugs or errors.

Feel free to explore and contribute!   😉
